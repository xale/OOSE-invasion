BUGS:
After capturing a pirate, a bulgar may make any available move (it is not limited to jumps.) [FIXED]

Weird diagonal-capture thing: [FIXED]
(x, y) zero-indexed
Pirate:	(3, 3) -> (3, 4)
Bulgar:	(4, 5) -> (3, 5)
P:	(5, 3) -> (5, 4)
B:	(3, 5) -> (3, 3)
	(3, 3) -> (2, 4)

Players cannot end turn without moving, even if they have no valid moves.

Minor (not specified by the spec, but annoying):
Error messages are rather vague.
Players must end their turns before victory conditions are tested.
